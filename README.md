## Reaktor Internship Problem

I have solved everything, including writing structured codes, designing an app interface that is minimalist yet
easy to find information and writing some Jest tests, even if they are a bit simplistic. The point is to
testing critical details of the components.

Some components can be quite a little bit repetitive; however, I think it is better to write
a simple solution than relying on an elegant solution.

The last remaning step is deployment, which I am working on it a bit.

Due to the limitations of the API itself, there is not much I can do to improve
the site speed, given its massive amount of datasets.
